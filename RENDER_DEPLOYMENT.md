# Render Deployment Configuration - FINAL SOLUTION

## Current Working Configuration

The build script has been updated to include dependency installation:

```json
"build": "npm install --include=dev && npx vite build"
```

## Render Dashboard Configuration

Configure these settings in your Render service dashboard:

### Service Settings:
- **Root Directory**: `./` (or leave empty)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Start Command**: `npm start`

### Environment Variables:
- **NODE_ENV**: `production`

## What Was Fixed

1. **Build Script**: Now installs dependencies before building
2. **Vite Config**: Simplified to avoid complex path resolution issues
3. **Dependencies**: Vite and Svelte tools moved to `dependencies`

## Files Modified

- `package.json`: Updated build script and moved dependencies
- `vite.config.js`: Simplified configuration
- `render.yaml`: Updated for new build process
- `.nvmrc`: Set to Node.js 20

## Troubleshooting

If the build still fails:
1. Clear Render's build cache
2. Ensure the latest commit is deployed
3. Check that all files are committed to git
4. Verify Node.js version is 20

## Dependencies Note

The following packages are in `dependencies` because they're needed for the build:
- vite
- svelte  
- @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte

The build command ensures all dependencies (including dev) are installed before building.
